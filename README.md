Check Your Understanding:

1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. This is because it is very reliant on the same application on a separate device.
2. Yes, a unit test could be used to test the "text message length" feature of a messiaging applicaiton. This is because it is only reliant on one user, and does not deal with the complex mechanisms of component interaction. It also is not reliant much on the ability to send messages from one place to another.
